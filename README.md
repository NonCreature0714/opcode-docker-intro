# OpCode Docker Intro

Hello and welcome to [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/)'s Phoenix Chapter.

This is an introduction to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for a range of skill sets, and will follow [Docker's official documents](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/), in addition to providing some expanded use cases for beginners and experience developer who are unfamiliar with it.

## Why teach Docker to newbies? 

In short, Docker makes learning how to code happen more quickly.

Why? Because, as a beginner, you can dive right into using Linux, Apache, MySQL, MongoDB, Node.js, Python, and so forth but **without having to worry about installing all of this directly on your laptop**. AND you can begin to familiarize yourself with cloud-based technology, a rapidly growing and high-salaried field.

Docker will also allow an experienced web developer to run live web pages on a laptop, complete with network requests, as the site is on the web... FOR FREE. And, once the site is ready to go live, all a developer needs to do is install Docker on a web server, do some minor configuration, and ship and run a container on the server.

## To Start

 1. Sign up for Github
 2. Make a `~/development` directory
    
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/development
    ```

 3. Navigate to your development directory

    ```bash
    cd ~/development
    ```

 4. Clone this repo ([follow these instructions to install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NonCreature0714/opcode-docker-intro.git
    ```
