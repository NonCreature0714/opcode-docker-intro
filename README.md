# OpCode Docker Intro

Hello and welcome to [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/)'s Phoenix Chapter.

This is an introduction to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for a range of skill sets, and will follow [Docker's official documents](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/), in addition to providing some expanded use cases for beginners and experience developer who are unfamiliar with it.

***Some of this intro may seem tedious, but there is a reason for the "extra" steps.*** And that is to get new or interested developers up-and-running on common industry skills, like working in a terminal, and Git and branching.

## Why teach Docker to newbies? 

In short, Docker makes learning how to code happen more quickly.

Why? Because, as a beginner, you can dive right into using Linux, Apache, MySQL, MongoDB, Node.js, Python, and so forth but **without having to worry about installing all of this directly on your laptop**. AND you can begin to familiarize yourself with cloud-based technology, a rapidly growing and high-salaried field.

Docker will also allow an experienced web developer to run live web pages on a laptop, complete with network requests, as the site is on the web... FOR FREE. And, once the site is ready to go live, all a developer needs to do is install Docker on a web server, do some minor configuration, and ship and run a container on the server.

## Setup the environment

Once [Docker Community Edition (CE)](https://runnable.com/docker/getting-started/) (Hyperlink to runnable.com, which includes extra easy-to-read materials, and quickly links to official Docker installer for your OS.) is installed, open a terminal (or PowerShell) and follow these steps:

 1. Sign up for Github
 2. Make a `~/development` directory
    
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/development
    ```

 3. Navigate to your development directory

    ```bash
    cd ~/development
    ```

 4. Clone this repo ([follow these instructions to install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NonCreature0714/opcode-docker-intro.git
    ```

 5. Navigate to the project

    ```bash
    cd opcode-docker-intro/
    ```
 
 6. Checkout your own branch

    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-branch
    ```
