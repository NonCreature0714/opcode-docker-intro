# OpCode Docker Intro

Hello and welcome to [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/)'s Phoenix Chapter.

This is an introduction to Docker for a range of skill sets, and will follow [Docker's official documents](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/), in addition to providing some expanded use cases for beginners and experience developer who are unfamiliar with it.

## Why teach Docker to newbies? 

In short, it will make learning how to code happen more quickly. 

Why? Because, as a beginner, you can dive right into using Linux, Apache, MySQL, MongoDB, Node.js, Python, and so forth but without having to worry about installing all of this directly on your laptop. AND you can begin to familiarize yourself with cloud-based technology, a rapidly growing field.
